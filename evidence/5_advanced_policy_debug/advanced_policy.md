**Approved by:** Chief Information Officer

## 1. Purpose  

This document formalizes the override of Policy 304a (Original Policy: *Data Processing Governance*). The modification is necessary to accommodate new regulatory requirements that allow the processing of user data under specific circumstances without the previously required consent.

---

## 2. Scope  

This override applies to all Business Units, IT Systems, and third‑party vendors that process personal data on behalf of the organization. The change affects all data processing activities covered by the original Policy 304a.

## 3. Definitions  

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Override** | A formal departure from an existing policy provision when a specific, documented justification exists. |

| **Third‑Party Vendor** | Any external entity that provides data processing services on behalf of the organization. |

## 4. Override Statement  

| Policy 304a Element | Original Provision | Override Provision | Rationale |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Consent Requirement** | All processing of personal data must be preceded by explicit user consent. | Consent is optional for the following categories:  <br>- Processing for critical infrastructure monitoring. <br>- Processing for anti‑fraud investigations that comply with regulatory exemptions. | Recent regulatory guidance now allows such exemptions under strict safeguards. |
| **Data Retention Period** | Minimum retention of 5 years for security logs. | Minimum retention extended to 7 years for security logs where required for ongoing investigations. | Extended retention supports longer‑term forensic capabilities. |
